## 📖 Project Overview

SoloDesk addresses the common challenges faced by freelancers and small business owners: managing multiple clients, tracking projects, generating invoices, and maintaining organized business operations. 

This project demonstrates my ability to build a complete, production-ready web application that solves real-world business problems. It showcases full-stack development skills, modern architecture patterns, and attention to user experience.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack (What Makes It Tick)

*SoloDesk is built using the MERN stack, demonstrating proficiency in modern full-stack development technologies.*

- **Node.js**: The JavaScript runtime that powers the entire backend server

### Additional Technologies
- **Tailwind CSS** - For beautiful, responsive styling
- **JWT Authentication** - Keeps your account secure
- **React Router** - Handles navigation between different pages
- **React Query** - Manages server state and data fetching
- **Framer Motion** - Adds smooth animations and transitions
- **Recharts** - Creates beautiful data visualizations for analytics
- **React Hook Form** - Handles form validation and submission
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful, customizable icons
- **Mongoose** - Makes working with MongoDB easier and more organized
