# Welcome Email Feature Setup Guide

## Overview

This feature automatically sends personalized welcome emails to clients when they are registered through the `AddClientModal.jsx` component. The email includes:

- Personalized greeting with the client's name
- Professional introduction from the freelancer/business owner
- Service highlights and expectations
- Contact information
- Branded design using SoloDesk's color scheme (#210B2C, #BC96E6, #FFD166)

## How It Works

1. **Client Creation**: When a user creates a new client through the AddClientModal
2. **Email Trigger**: The `createClient` function in `server/controllers/clientController.js` automatically triggers the welcome email
3. **Email Content**: The email is personalized with:
   - Client name (individual or company)
   - User's business information
   - Professional welcome message
   - Contact details

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

```env
# Email Configuration (Gmail)
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-gmail-app-password
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Database Configuration
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string

# JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
```

### 2. Gmail App Password Setup

To use Gmail for sending emails, you need to create an App Password:

1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Navigate to Security â†’ 2-Step Verification
3. Create an App Password for "Mail"
4. Use this password as `EMAIL_PASS` in your environment variables

### 3. Testing the Feature

Run the test script to verify the email functionality:

```bash
cd server
node test-welcome-email.js
```

## Email Template Features

### Design Elements
- **Color Scheme**: Uses SoloDesk's brand colors (#210B2C, #BC96E6, #FFD166)
- **Typography**: Inter font family for modern, professional look
- **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly design
- **Branding**: Includes business name and logo area

### Content Sections
1. **Header**: Business name and tagline
2. **Greeting**: Personalized welcome message
3. **Introduction**: Professional introduction from the service provider
4. **Service Highlights**: What clients can expect
5. **Contact Information**: Email, phone, website
6. **Footer**: Professional closing and additional links

### Personalization
The email is automatically personalized with:
- Client's name (individual or company name)
- User's first name
- Business name
- Contact information
- Website (if available)

## Code Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **`server/services/emailService.js`**
   - Added `sendClientWelcomeEmail` function
   - HTML and text email templates
   - Error handling

2. **`server/controllers/clientController.js`**
   - Modified `createClient` function
   - Added email sending after successful client creation
   - Error handling to prevent email failures from breaking client creation

### Key Functions

```javascript
// Send welcome email to new client
const sendClientWelcomeEmail = async (clientData, userData) => {
  // Creates personalized email with client and user data
  // Sends via Gmail SMTP
  // Returns success/error status
};
```

## Error Handling

The implementation includes robust error handling:

- **Email Failures**: Won't break client creation
- **Missing User Data**: Graceful fallback to default values
- **SMTP Errors**: Logged but don't affect the main flow
- **Validation**: Ensures required fields are present

## Customization

### Modifying Email Content

To customize the email content, edit the `sendClientWelcomeEmail` function in `server/services/emailService.js`:

```javascript
// Change the subject line
subject: `Welcome to ${userBusinessName}!`,

// Modify the greeting
<p class="greeting">Hello ${clientName},</p>

// Add custom service descriptions
<div class="service-text">Your custom service description</div>
```

### Adding New Fields

To include additional user or client information:

1. Update the User model query in `clientController.js`:
```javascript
const user = await User.findById(userId).select('firstName lastName email phone businessName website customField');
```

2. Use the new field in the email template:
```javascript
${userData.customField ? `<div>${userData.customField}</div>` : ''}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Email Not Sending**
   - Check environment variables are set correctly
   - Verify Gmail app password is valid
   - Check server logs for SMTP errors

2. **Authentication Errors**
   - Ensure 2FA is enabled on Gmail account
   - Use App Password, not regular password
   - Check Gmail account security settings

3. **Template Issues**
   - Verify HTML syntax in email template
   - Check for missing template variables
   - Test with different client types (Individual vs Company)

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by adding to your environment:

```env
DEBUG=email:*
```

## Security Considerations

- **App Passwords**: Use Gmail App Passwords instead of regular passwords
- **Environment Variables**: Never commit email credentials to version control
- **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing email rate limiting for production
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure client consent for email communications

## Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. **Email Service**: Consider using a dedicated email service (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.)
2. **Domain**: Use a custom domain for sending emails
3. **Monitoring**: Implement email delivery monitoring
4. **Compliance**: Ensure GDPR/email compliance for your region

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the server logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Test the email service independently using the test script
4. Review the Gmail account settings and app password configuration
